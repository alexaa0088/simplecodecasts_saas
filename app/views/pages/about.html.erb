                <p>Welcome to Dev Junction. We are a community of developers, entrepreneurs, and investors who are interested in meeting one another and sharing ideas.</p>
                <p>Bringing together experts, beginners and enthusiasts alike to meet and discuss a wide array of topics related to technologies and writing code. We hold the occasional networking events, and we get involved in developer challenge events.</p>
                <p>Follow us on Twitter (@DevJunction) and add us on Google+ . Some of our talks will be posted as Hangout On Air videos to our G+ feed.</p>
                <p>Please see our G+ feed for specific details of each event. We currently require attendees to RSVP in this MeetUp group.</p>
                <p>Our meetings are always free and open to the general public. We will sometimes co-host joint meetings with other local MeetUp groups.</p>
